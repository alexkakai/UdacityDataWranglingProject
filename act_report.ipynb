The data contains information about the dog e.g. a photo of the dog, name, breed or 'age group' and rating of the dog. Secondary data also obtained from the data are retweet counts, favorite count. The goal of this report is to gather all the data partaining the WeRateDogs account (there are three different datasets), assesses the data, noting all the issues persent, cleaning the noted issues and perform vaious analysis.\n",

    "  <p>There is a positive correlation between retweet count and favorite count, an increase in retweet count would mean also there would an increase in the favourites counts</p>\n",
